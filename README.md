# EIGRP-Network-Project2
Cisco Packet Tracer project using EIGRP for dynamic routing
🚀 Designed a Cisco Packet Tracer Project using EIGRP! 🚀

I recently worked on a Cisco networking project implementing EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) in Packet Tracer. This project demonstrates efficient dynamic routing between multiple routers while ensuring optimized data flow in the network.

🔹 Network Topology Includes:

✅ 3 Routers (R1, R2, R3) running EIGRP

✅ 3 Switches (S1, S2, S3) for LAN connectivity

✅ 6 End devices (PCs) connected to different subnets

✅ Proper subnetting and IP addressing

✅ Seamless communication using EIGRP protocol

💡 Key Takeaways:

✔️ Implemented EIGRP for fast convergence and loop-free routing

✔️ Configured routing tables dynamically instead of static routing

✔️ Ensured efficient communication between different subnets

🔍 EIGRP vs. OSPF – Which One is Better?

While working on this project, I explored the differences between EIGRP and OSPF:

✅ EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

✔️ Cisco proprietary (works only on Cisco devices)

✔️ Hybrid routing protocol (distance vector + link-state)

✔️ Faster convergence than OSPF

✔️ Uses DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm) for path selection

✅ OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

✔️ Open standard (works on any vendor’s device)

✔️ Pure link-state protocol using Dijkstra’s SPF algorithm

✔️ Better scalability for large networks

✔️ Slower convergence compared to EIGRP but more structured

💡 When to Use What?

🔹 Use EIGRP if working within a Cisco-only environment for faster convergence.

🔹 Use OSPF if interoperability across multiple vendors is required.
